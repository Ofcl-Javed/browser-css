# Live-CSS

Live-CSS is a Basic Html Page where you can edit the CSS in the browser and see changed right away. It consists of a single Html page with ```<style>``` tag. By default the style tag is not shown in the DOM but by styling the ```<style>``` tag (Yes we can style the style tag as any other html tags) using inline style and using ```display : block; ``` you can see the content in the browser. The attribute ```content-editable``` allow you to edit any tag content in the html on the browser. And That's how simple this is.
